``In the theory of communications, it is appropriate to represent an oscillatory signal as the
superposition of elementary wavelets pocessing both  a well-defined frequency and a localization
in time.  Indeed, the pertinent information is often carried simultaneously by the frequency
emitted and by the temporal structure of the signal--- the example of music is
characteristic. The representation of a signal as a function of time does not bring out the
frequencies in play, whereas on the other hand, the Fourier representation conceals the moment
of emission and the duration of each of the components of the signal. An adequate representation
ought to combine the advantages of the two complementary descriptions; it ought also to be in a
discrete form, which is better suited to the theory of communications".  <br>

``The discovery that quantum physics allows
   fundamentally new modes of information
     processing has required the existing
   theories of computation, information and
    cryptography to be superseded by their
   quantum generalisations. The Centre for
      Quantum Computation, part of the
  University of Oxford, conducts theoretical
  and experimental research into all aspects
   of quantum information processing, and
     into the implications of the quantum
   theory of computation for physics itself'' <br>
