I wrote down what Jeff said. to make an equation shown on web.


1. make  "file.tex"  (containing equation)

2. type "latex2html file.tex "
% the software latex2html will translate/convert tex.file to html file
with image and other stuff all in one folder. so I can enter the folder 
to locate what I want for web design.

3. PUT img1.png e.g. into my html.file and view it. 

Rmk: usually the image does not have bkgroud color so I donot have to
use "import" to save the color as "yellow.bmp" say, then use "gimp "
to edit it.

The other way of snapshot on web. (without using latex2html) is:

1. create a dvi.file (or pdf or ps) file.   using latex.

2. then type "import filename.png or file.jpg" (after hearing two 
beeps) to select area of screen
from the dvi-show screen to import and save as file.jpg say.

3.  Put file.png/ file/jpg in html.  


Rmk.  usually the image has a white bkground from the dvi.-screen.

we can use gimp to edit it with appropriate color.

The tools are "pick" (pencil-like) and ".." (barrel-like) to fill in the 
backgroud or some part of the image.
