</p><p>This is a five (5) hour introductory Calculus course designed primarily

for engineering majors and certain other technical majors. As mentioned

above, the text is Calculus by Stewart, 5<sup>th</sup> edition. The student

is assumed to be capable and versed in the standard Pre-Calculus topics,

functions, graphing, solving equations, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric

functions. No prior exposure to Calculus is assumed. Since this is a five

hour class, the student should expect at least 4 hour exams and a final

exam. Of course, the testing and evaluation for each class is entirely

at the discretion of the instructor. Regarding the use of technology in

the classroom, no departmental policy is presently in place. Some sections

require the use of calculators and some classes prohibit them. The student

is advised to consult with the instructor about this topic.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>The student should emerge from the class with

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>1) A basic introduction to limits and continuity for functions of a

single variable.

</p><p>2) The ability to differentiate the elementary functions and apply those

derivatives to solve problems.

</p><p>3) An awareness of the foundations of the Riemann Integral and some

of its applications.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>A specific section by section suggested syllabus and appropriate comments

are shown below

<p>Syllabus</p></center>



<p><br>

<br>

</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b>- Optional- This is a Pre-Calculus review chapter and

may be briefly discussed or assigned at the discretion of the instructor.

Incoming students should be familiar with the topics in this chapter. Most

faculty skip this chapter.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b>

</p><p>Section 2.1- Optional. Motivational devices for limits. In this section,

the author uses the problems of tangents and velocities to motivate the

notion of a limit. If the instructor wishes, he may employ this idea.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>Sections 2.2 and 2.3 - Limits and limit laws. The approach is non-rigorous

here. Most faculty present the non-rigorous approach before the epsilon-delta

definition.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>Section 2.4 - Epsilon-delta definitions. The instructor should use their

own discretion in this section. This material is more abstract than most

of the material in a beginning textbook. If you are new to teaching, you

might wish to see the course coordinator (Paul Britt e-mail to tennisguy@home.com

or 388-4738) or consult with some of your colleagues about this topic.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>Section 2.5 - Continuity. Continuity, the basic hypothesis for most

Calculus theorems, is often misunderstood by the beginning student. The

instructor should explore the topic in full so that confusion might be

avoided later in the course.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>Section 2.6 - Limits at infinity and horizontal asymptotes. This is

a fairly basic subject.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>Sections 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 - Tangents, velocities and derivatives. This

is the true introduction to the derivative as a limit of a difference quotient.

The student should be made aware of the derivative as an instantaneous

rate of change, a tangent line slope and the velocity of a particle. Too

many students emerge from beginning classes with an ability to compute

difficult derivatives with little or no idea about the nature of the derivative.

The instructor is advised to stress interpretation of what a derivative

tells us. This is the section where that instruction begins.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b>Chapter 3</b>

</p><p>Sections 3.1 and 3.2 Differentiation of polynomials, exponentials and

the product and quotient rules. Many textbooks have begun to introduce

transcendental functions early in the course. The thinking is that if a

topic is introduced early and used often, the students will be more inclined

to realize its importance. Thus, the differentiation of exponentials in

section 3.1.

</p><p>Section 3.3 Optional - Rates of change. I prefer to cover this topic.

This section gives examples of derivatives in use in other fields. The

students should know that derivatives are not just used in math class.

This discussion also continues the exposition about interpretation of the

derivative. The students are exposed to the idea that a derivative is not

simply a formula.

</p><p>Section 3.4 Derivatives of trig functions. The material is standard.

The students may not recall as much trig as the instructor deems appropriate.

</p><p>Section 3.5 Chain Rule - This topic seems to be troublesome for the

student. I suspect the problem begins in their algebra courses. They cannot

differentiate composed functions very easily because they do not really

understand composition itself.

</p><p>Section 3.6 Implicit Differentiation - A standard presentation.

</p><p>Section 3.7 Higher Derivatives - A standard presentation.

</p><p>Section 3.8 Derivatives of logarithms - A non-standard presentation.

The standard presentation is in a later section.

</p><p>Section 3.9 Optional - Hyperbolic Functions - The decision is left to

the instructor.

</p><p>Section 3.10 Related rates - This topic gives the students some trouble

because they do not understand the chain rule. The student has to be made

aware that differentiation of rates involves differentiating with respect

to time.

</p><p>Section 3.11 Linearization and differentials - The tangent line. The

first degree Taylor approximation to f (x). The student should understand

the geometric interpretations of dy and&nbsp; delta y.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b>Chapter 4</b>

</p><p>Section 4.1 Maximum and minium values of functions - An extremely important,

but fairly easy topic.

</p><p>Section 4.2 The Mean Value Theorem - The building block for the proofs

of many other basic Calculus theorems. This theorem is open to a very interesting

physical, as well as a geometric interpretation.

</p><p>Section 4.3 Derivatives and Graphs - Another section in which the student

is taught interpretation of derivatives. This section includes increasing,

decreasing, concavity and the first and second derivatives tests. A very

important section.

</p><p>Section 4.4 L'Hopital's Rule - A fairly standard presentation.

</p><p>Section 4.5 Curve sketching - The summary section for elementary graphing

techniques.

</p><p>Section 4.6 Optional - Calculus and calculators - A fairly nice treatment

of some pros and cons of calculator usage.

</p><p>Section 4.7 Optimization problems - The student will encounter some

difficulty in this section. Expect to spend more than one day on this topic.

</p><p>Section 4.8 Optional - Economic applications - Coverage left to the

discretion of the instructor.

</p><p>Section 4.9 Newton's Method - The material on Newton's Method should

not be considered as optional. This method of finding roots, while not

robust, does offer the students reinforcement of the geometric interpretation

of the derivative and the ideas of convergence.

</p><p>Section 4.10 Antiderivative - Fairly standard topic.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b>Chapter 5</b>

</p><p>Section 5.1 Optional - Areas and distances - This section seeks to motivate

the idea of a Definite Integral using areas and distances. If the instructor

is pressed for time, this section may be omitted and the general integral

from section 5.2 can be taught.

</p><p>Section 5.2 Definite Integral - Fairly standard presentation.

</p><p>Sections 5.3 and 5.4 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus - Be aware that

students often emerge from this class knowing only the second form of the

theorem (Integral Evaluation Result). The first form, while easily forgotten,

shows the beautiful interplay between derivative and integral.

</p><p>Section 5.5 Substitutions - Students have trouble with this topic. Since

the idea of substitution is so important in Calculus II, the instructor

should be very sure that his students receive adequate practice in this

topic.

</p><p>Section 5.6 Optional - Logarithm defined as an integral - This section

revisits the exponential and logarithm functions and defines them in the

traditional, rigorous manner.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b>Chapter 6</b>

</p><p>Section 6.1 Areas between curves - A fairly standard presentation.

</p><p>Section 6.2 Volumes of solids of revolution and slicing problems - Many

student have a great deal of difficulty with these topics. The instructor

should illustrate his examples with pictures (to the best of his ability).

Be advised that even with marvelously drawn examples, the volumes by slicing

represent some of the more challenging problems in Calculus I. The students

do not "see" well in three dimensions.

</p><p>Section 6.3 Volumes by shells - As per the above, copious illustrations

may make this topic easier for your students.

</p><p>Section 6.4 - Work - The instructor and the students are advised to

be careful with the units. Sometimes the book might accidentally trick

you.

</p><p>Section 6.5 - Mean Value Theorem for Integrals - A fairly standard topic.

A geometric interpretation may aid the students.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b>Chapter 8</b>

</p><p>Sections 8.1 and 8.2 Optional - Arc length and area of a surface of

revolution - Fairly standard presentation.

</p><p>Section 8.3 Optional - Physics applications - This section incorporates

fluid pressure, mass and center of mass problems. Again the warning about

units in appropriate. Remember, there is a difference between mass-density

and weight-density.

<br>&nbsp;

</p><p><b>Review</b><br>

<br> Before the final we will spend time (about 50 minutes) going over the major topics that 
have been
covered in the class. 

</p><p><!The guidelines above are just that, guidelines. I am available to discuss

the course with you. If you have any questions, please stop by to chat.>
