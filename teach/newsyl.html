<font color="green">**If you know BEFORE an exam that you have a conflict, 
contact me in advance. In this case, it is sometimes 
possible to arrange an early exam.**</font> <BR> <bR>

<!--
<STRONG> Philosophy.</STRONG> Real learning requires your active involvement. 
The grading scheme rewards involvement and dedication, 
 by putting a lot of points on the section 
work, homework and midterm exams.  
<! (It is a maxim in mathematics that >
<!you really learn a subject when you have to teach it.)> --><br>

<strong> Calculator.</strong> 
The use of calculator will be helpful for some homework and section quizzes. 
But it is not required to have 
 knowledge of operating your calculator at an advanced level.
A regular Texas Instruments graphics calculator (TI-82,83, ...) 
should be sufficient.
