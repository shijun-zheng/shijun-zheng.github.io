</ul>

<ul>
<LI>6.7: 3, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20 <br> 
(for #20: it suffices to just plug in the definition of cosh 
in terms of exponentials, and compute) 
<LI>6.8*: 3, 8, 11, 13,  20, 29 
</ul>

<LI> 8.5: 26, 27, 29  
<LI>8.6:  3, 7, 17, 22, 29 <br>
[Use symmetry when you can. e.g., in #7, 
 one coordinate <br> of the center of gravity is obvious by symmetry.]
</ul>

<ul>
<LI>9.1: 8, 9, 12, 18, 26 
</ul>

<LI>9.3:  6, 12, 16, 20, 21, 23, 26, 28 <br> 
[and, optional for the mathematically ambitious:  41]<br> 
Hints: <br> 
6. Can you show the n-th term is > n? Show work. <br> 
21. (a-b)(a+b)= a^2 - b^2; multiply by (a+b)/(a+b)
for appropriate a,b. Show your work. 

<LI>9.4: 12, 13, 
 16, 20 [Hint: if you don't see the pattern, write out 
the sum of the first five terms,and you will], 
29, 31, 42, 48a, 54, 60.
</ul> 

<ul>
<LI>9.5:  2, 5, 6, 10, 18, 22, 30<br> [Hint on #30: the jth truncation 
error here will be smaller than the integral from x=j to infinity 
of the function (1/x)^{4/3}, as you can see by drawing boxes under 
the graph whose areas correspond to terms of the series.] 
</ul> 

<ul>
<LI>9.6: 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 18

<LI>9.7: Determine whether the series converges conditionally,
 absolutely or not at all in the following (in each 
case justify your answer):<br>
 2, 8 [Hint: f(x) is decreasing when f'(x)<0], 13, 28, 30. <br>

Also do  17, 37, 40. 
</ul> 

<ul> 
<li> 
9.8: 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20: <br>
for each of these problems, just give 
the radius of convergence (not the interval).
</ul>


<ul> 
<LI>9.8: 21, 22, 30, 42 

<LI>9.9: 1, 7, 8, 11, 13, 20, 23, 25
