<STRONG>Grading.</STRONG> 
The weighting in your course score  points (500 possible) will be 
<UL>
<LI>        200     Final Exam          
<LI>        200     Two midterm exams   
<!LI> <! &nbsp  50     Written homework> 
<!li> <! &nbsp  50     Webassign homework>
<li>   100     Quizzes 
</UL> 
(Point totals will be normalized to these relative weights. 
Section work will be possibly group work but 
 including quizzes.) 
<br>
<BR>

<STRONG>Course Grades. </STRONG>  
 Here is the correspondence of course grade and percentage 
of possible points scored: <br>
A 90-100%, B 80-89%, C 70-79%, D 60-69%.
F 0-59%. 
<!It is possible  that the curve >
<!will be relaxed, but this is by no means assured.>
<!No matter how embarassing the grade inflation -- the curve won't be 
made tougher.>

<BR><BR> 

<STRONG>Make-ups.</STRONG> Make-ups for quizzes will be given only for a very reasonable excuse.
<!There will be no make-ups for quizzes.>  
<!If illness, a death in the family, car trouble or> 
<!a faulty alarm clock cause you to >
<!miss a midterm -- that is the midterm or section quiz  you will drop.> 
<!So do not decide an earlier midterm or quiz is going to be your>

<font color="green">**If you know BEFORE an exam that you have a conflict, 
contact me in advance. In this case, it is sometimes 
possible to arrange an early exam.**</font> <BR> <bR>

<!--
<STRONG> Philosophy.</STRONG> 
Real learning requires your active involvement. 
The grading scheme rewards involvement and dedication, 
 by putting a lot of points on the section 
work, homework and midterm exams.  
The  midterm exams will not be surprises, they will 
be closely related to the work you will have done. 
<BR>
Note especially, you really need to be careful to keep up 
with the homework. Get into a groove.
<BR><BR> 
<! (It is a maxim in mathematics that >
<!you really learn a subject when you have to teach it.)> --><br>

<br><br>

<strong> Calculator.</strong> 
The use of calculator will be helpful for some homework and section quizzes.
But it is not required to have
 knowledge of operating your calculator at an advanced level.
A regular Texas Instruments graphics calculator (TI-82,83, ...)
should be sufficient.

<!---You will need a programmable graphics 
calculator for some homework and section quizzes. 
You will need to put two programs on the calculator. 
You are responsible 
for knowing how to operate your calculator, but  
for some 
Texas Instruments graphics calculators (TI-82,83, ...) 
the two programs are on the course page.--->  
 <br>

<!Calculators are NOT allowed on midterm tests, 
or on the final.>
