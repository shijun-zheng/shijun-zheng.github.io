<STRONG>Grading.</STRONG> 
The weighting in your course score  points (780 possible) will be 
<UL>
<LI>        200 &nbsp    Final Exam          
<LI>        100 each  &nbsp   Four midterm exams (the lowerest one will be halved)   
<LI>    50   &nbsp  Written homework 
<!li> <! &nbsp  50     Webassign homework>
<li>   50    &nbsp Quizzes 
<li>   130  &nbsp Eight Matlab projects 
</UL> 
(Point totals will be normalized to these relative weights. 
Matlab assignment will be possibly group work.) 
<br>
<BR>

<STRONG>Course Grades. </STRONG>  

Your grade will be based on a point total, probably with a curve applied. 
There will be a total of 750 points: 200
for the final, 350 for the hour exams (100 points each but the lowest 
score is halved), and 100 for quizzes and
homework, and 100 for computer projects. 
 There will be four computer assignments which 
will be graded. You will be encouraged
to work in small groups on these computer assignments. The preferred 
language will be Matlab. Previous Matlab
experience is not required. A Matlab primer is available <a 
href=''http://www.math.umd.edu/~hck/241f01syl.html''>here</a>. The mfile 
you need for multiple integration may
be downloaded by clicking <a href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~hck/241f01syl.html">here</a>.
<br><br>

<STRONG>Make-ups.</STRONG> Makeupsfor exams will be given
only in extreme circumstances in
accordance with official University policy. Except for unforseeable
events, requests for a makeup must be made
before the exam is given. 
<!There will be no make-ups for quizzes.>  
<!If illness, a death in the family, car trouble or> 
<!a faulty alarm clock cause you to >
<!miss a midterm -- that is the midterm or section quiz  you will drop.> 
<!So do not decide an earlier midterm or quiz is going to be your> 

<br>
<font color="green">**If you know BEFORE an exam that you have a conflict, 
contact me in advance. In this case, it is sometimes 
possible to arrange an early exam.**</font> <BR> <bR>

<!--
<STRONG> Philosophy.</STRONG> 
Real learning requires your active involvement. 
The grading scheme rewards involvement and dedication, 
 by putting a lot of points on the section 
work, homework and midterm exams.  
The  midterm exams will not be surprises, they will 
be closely related to the work you will have done. 
<BR>
Note especially, you really need to be careful to keep up 
with the homework. Get into a groove.
<BR><BR> 
<! (It is a maxim in mathematics that >
<!you really learn a subject when you have to teach it.)> --><br>

<br><br>

<strong> Calculator.</strong> 
The use of calculator could be helpful (but not necessary)  for some homework and 
section quizzes.
  It is not required to have
 knowledge of operating your calculator at an advanced level.
<!A regular Texas Instruments graphics calculator (TI-82,83, ...)
should be sufficient.>

On the hour exams, however, graphing and programmable calculators will not be 
allowed.  If you wish, you may use a cheap
scientific calculator, but it should not be needed.

<!Calculators are NOT allowed on midterm tests, 
or on the final.>
