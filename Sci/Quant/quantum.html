<p> <red>M.Planck</red> (1900):<br>

E=h*\omega  (the energy E of a quantum being proportional to the circular frequency of radiation 
\omega)
<br>
where <orange>h= 1.05*10 <sup>-27</sup></orange>erg.sec.  ------ Planck's constant.


<p>
A.Einstein (1905):<br> 

p=2 Pi*h/ \lambda  (p--length of the momentum vector, \lambda-- light wavelength)

Experiments are the only means of knowledge at our disposal. The rest is poetry, imagination.

------ Planck

<br>
 Q:  When is the time for our imagination to unfold ?

 A: When the mathematical or physical experiment is done.

The series is divergent; therefore we may be able to do something with it.

The shortest path between two truths in the real domains passes through the complex 
domain.

The function of an expert is not to be more right than other people, but to be wrong for more 
sophisticated reasons.
